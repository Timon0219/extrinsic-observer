# Bittensor Network Observer

This project is designed to observe and report on specific events and transactions occurring on the Bittensor blockchain network. It focuses on monitoring scheduled coldkey swaps, network dissolves, voting activities, and other critical network events.

## Features

- **Block Monitoring**: Observes current blocks for specific extrinsics and events.
- **Event Detection**: Identifies key events such as scheduled coldkey swaps, network dissolves, and voting activities.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts relevant information from extrinsics and events.
- **Report Generation**: Creates detailed reports for each detected event.
- **Validator Information**: Retrieves and includes validator names and links in reports when available.
- **Database Integration**: Uses SQLite to store and retrieve validator and owner information.
- **Discord Notifications**: Sends event reports to specified Discord channels using webhooks.
- **Data Collection**: Fetches and stores owner and validator information from the TaoStats API.

## Key Components

1. **Substrate Interface**: Connects to the Bittensor network using the SubstrateInterface.
2. **Block Data Retrieval**: Fetches block data and associated events from the blockchain.
3. **Extrinsic Processing**: Analyzes extrinsics for specific function calls related to coldkey swaps, network dissolves, and voting.
4. **Event Processing**: Processes events to extract relevant information and confirm transaction success.
5. **Report Generation**: Creates formatted reports for each detected event, including relevant details and timestamps.
6. **Database Queries**: Retrieves validator and owner information from a local SQLite database.
7. **Discord Integration**: Sends reports to Discord channels using webhooks.
8. **Data Collection**: Fetches owner and validator data from TaoStats API and stores it in the SQLite database.

## Environment Setup

Before running the script, you need to set up the following environment variables:

```
COLDKEY_SWAP_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=""
DISSOLVE_NETWORK_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=""
TAOSTATS_API_KEY=""
```

These environment variables are used for:
- Sending notifications to specific Discord channels for coldkey swaps and network dissolves.
- Authenticating with the TaoStats API for additional network information.

You can set these variables in your system environment or use a `.env` file with a library like `python-dotenv` to load them.

## Main Functions

- `setup_substrate_interface()`: Initializes the connection to the Bittensor network.
- `get_block_data()`: Retrieves block and event data for a given block number.
- `check_extrinsic()`: Searches for specific extrinsic calls in a block.
- `process_swap_extrinsics()`: Extracts details from coldkey swap events.
- `process_dissolve_extrinsics()`: Extracts details from network dissolve events.
- `process_vote()`: Extracts voting details from extrinsics.
- `generate_report()`: Creates formatted reports for detected events.
- `get_validator_name()`: Retrieves validator information from the database.
- `get_owner_name()`: Retrieves owner information from the database.
- `observer_block()`: Main function that orchestrates the observation and reporting process.
- `convert_hex_to_ss58()`: Converts hexadecimal addresses to SS58 format.
- `fetch_all_validators()`: Fetches all validators from the TaoStats API using pagination.
- `find_owner_coldkey()`: Fetches owner coldkeys and subnet IDs from the API and saves them to the database.
- `find_validator_coldkey()`: Fetches validator coldkeys, hotkeys, amounts, and names from the API and saves them to the database.

## Data Collection and Database Setup

`observering/utils/get_coldkeys.py`
The script includes functions to collect and store data about owners and validators
It is using taostats api for integrating with infomation of validators and owners

1. `find_owner_coldkey()`: 
   - Fetches subnet owner data from the TaoStats API.
   - Converts hexadecimal addresses to SS58 format.
   - Stores subnet IDs and owner coldkeys in the `owners` table of the SQLite database.

2. `find_validator_coldkey()`:
   - Fetches validator data from the TaoStats API, including coldkeys, hotkeys, and staked amounts.
   - Retrieves validator names using the `get_validator_name()` function.
   - Stores validator information in the `validators` table of the SQLite database.

3. `get_validator_name()`:
   - Fetches validator names from the TaoStats API based on hotkey addresses.
   - Implements rate limiting handling to avoid API request limits.


## Usage

To use this script:
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Set up the required environment variables.
3. Run the script to populate the SQLite database with owner and validator information.
4. Once the database is populated, the `observer_block()` function can be used to start monitoring the Bittensor network for events.

## Dependencies

- pytz
- datetime
- substrateinterface
- bittensor
- sqlite3
- requests
- os
- time

## Note

This script is designed for monitoring and reporting purposes. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and comply with all relevant regulations when using this tool to observe blockchain activities. Keep your webhook URLs and API keys secure and do not share them publicly.

The data collection process may take some time due to API rate limits and the amount of data being fetched. Ensure you have a stable internet connection when running the data collection functions.
